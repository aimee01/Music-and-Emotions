# Music and Emotions

### Context ###
With this study I want to see if we could predict the emotion of a song from only numerical audio features. I chose to use my own music library to make the study.
I show in this repository how I extracted the audio features from my music using the library librosa as well as a short machine learning study on the dataset.

### References ###
To extract the audio features, I got inspired by the [GTZAN Dataset](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html).
